# SLIP-Self-Service-Toolkit
Our intention here is to provide generic scripts that data custodians will be able to easily understand and customise to their own organisational requirements. If you have a particular need or require furher help with automating data ingestion into SLIP self service please get in contact with us by emailing who@who.com.au. If you would like to help contribute to improving the tool kit please also get in touch.

To begin with we will provided basic scripts that data custodians can use to automate the following processes: 
1. Exporting data from common enterprise geodata environments into a supported SLIP self service formats. 
2. Automate the zipping up of data ready for uploading into self service. 
3. Tools and script to help upload your data into the self service environment. 
4. Finally the basics at setting up batch scheduling using either windows and linux environments
